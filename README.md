# Hi, I'm Zachary Leinweber

Hey there! I'm Zach (aka zleinweber), a systems engineer who loves clean infrastructure, clean code, and good music.

## What I Do

By day, I lead the Infrastructure Systems Engineering team at a trading firm. We're the ones who keep the Linux systems — and the infrastructure services that rely on them — running fast, reliably, and transparently.

We manage critical infrastructure like Postgres, Redpanda, and Prometheus, with a strong emphasis on automation and reproducibility. If it can be expressed in Ansible or Terraform, it probably is.

I care deeply about making infrastructure intuitive — not just for machines, but for the humans who work with it.

## Projects and Interests

*Coming soon*

## Values

I approach problems with calm rationality and methodical clarity.

In systems engineering, reliability is the core value — everything else is in sevice of that.

I also value kindness — in communication, in collaboration, and in the way we build tools for others to use.
